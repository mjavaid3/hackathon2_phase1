# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Implement a command-line Todo application with in-memory storage that supports the 5 required features: Add, List, Update, Delete, and Mark Complete/Incomplete tasks. The application will follow a modular architecture with dedicated modules for data models, storage, and CLI handling. The implementation will use Python dataclasses for Task entities, a dedicated InMemoryStorage class for data management, and a dictionary-based command dispatcher to handle user commands. All code will be fully type-hinted and PEP 8 compliant, using only Python standard library components as required by the constitution.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.12+ (as specified in constitution)
**Primary Dependencies**: Python standard library only (no external dependencies beyond stdlib, as specified in constitution)
**Storage**: In-memory storage using Python list/dict (as specified in constitution - no files/DB)
**Testing**: Manual verification based on feature requirements (no automated testing framework specified)
**Target Platform**: Cross-platform command-line application (Windows, macOS, Linux)
**Project Type**: Single project with modular structure (as specified in constitution)
**Performance Goals**: Fast response times for all operations (under 1 second for each command execution)
**Constraints**:
- No external libraries beyond Python standard library (as specified in constitution)
- Command-line interface using built-in input/print (no CLI frameworks like Click, Typer, Rich)
- In-memory storage only (no file/database persistence)
- All functions must be fully type-hinted and PEP 8 compliant (as specified in constitution)
**Scale/Scope**: Single-user application with limited number of tasks (hundreds, not thousands)

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- [x] Verify implementation follows "No Manual Coding Allowed" principle - all code generated by Qwen based on approved specifications
- [x] Confirm "Strict Spec-Driven Workflow" is followed - every feature preceded by written specification in /specs/history/
- [x] Ensure "Specification History Preservation" - all specs saved with sequential, descriptive filenames
- [x] Validate "Code Quality & Structure Requirements" - PEP 8, type hints, modular design, docstrings
- [x] Confirm "Technology & Constraints" compliance - Python 3.12+, UV dependency management, standard library only
- [x] Verify "Required Features Implementation" - all 5 required features fully implemented
- [x] Check "Additional Functional Requirements" - interactive loop, exit/quit, help command, validation
- [x] Confirm "Deliverables" are included - constitution, specs/history, src/, README.md, QWEN.md

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
