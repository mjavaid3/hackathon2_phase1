# Qwen Code Documentation for Todo App CLI

This document captures all prompts and iterations during the development of the Todo App CLI project.

## Project Overview

The Todo App CLI is a command-line todo application with in-memory storage, built with Python. It implements all 5 required features:
1. Add Task
2. List/View Tasks
3. Update Task
4. Delete Task
5. Mark Complete/Incomplete

## Architecture

The application follows a modular design with single responsibility:

### src/todo_app/
- `__init__.py` - Package initialization
- `main.py` - Entry point with command loop
- `models.py` - Task class/dataclass
- `storage.py` - InMemoryStorage class
- `cli.py` - Command parsing and handling

## Key Features

- Interactive command loop with prompt (e.g., "> ")
- Command: exit or quit to end program
- Help command: help (lists all available commands with brief descriptions)
- Input validation and clear error messages
- Tasks stored in memory only (list or dict, no file/database)

## Implementation Notes

- Follows PEP 8 strictly
- Full type hints on all functions and classes
- Modular design with single responsibility
- Clear docstrings for modules, classes, and public functions
- Meaningful variable/function/class names

## Prompts and Iterations

This project was developed using an agentic workflow with the following sequence:
1. Specification (spec.md) - defining requirements
2. Planning (plan.md) - technical approach
3. Task breakdown (tasks.md) - atomic implementation steps
4. Code generation - Qwen generated all code based on approved specifications

## Constitution Compliance

- No Manual Coding Allowed - All code generated by Qwen
- Strict Spec-Driven Workflow - Preceded by written specification
- Specification History Preservation - Saved with sequential filenames
- Code Quality & Structure Requirements - PEP 8, type hints, modular design
- Technology & Constraints - Python 3.12+, standard library only
- Required Features Implementation - All 5 features fully implemented
- Additional Functional Requirements - Interactive loop, validation, etc.
- Deliverables - All required artifacts included
